## **FAQ**

**How quickly can I switch to a renewable energy provider?**

Most states with deregulated electricity markets allow switching within 1-2 billing cycles, typically 30-60 days from enrollment. Providers like CleanChoice Energy and Verde Energy handle cancellation with your current supplier automatically—you simply enroll and they coordinate the transition without service interruption. No equipment changes or installations are required since renewable electricity flows through the same power lines as traditional generation.

**Do renewable energy plans actually cost less than regular electricity?**

Yes, many renewable energy providers offer competitive or lower rates than standard utility pricing due to falling wind and solar generation costs. Companies like SmartEnergy, CleanSky Energy, and Verde Energy regularly undercut fossil fuel electricity rates while delivering 100% renewable power. Specific savings depend on your location, current utility rates, and consumption patterns, but the perception that green energy costs significantly more is outdated.

**What happens to my electricity during storms or when wind/solar generation is low?**

Your power stays on because renewable energy providers don't physically deliver electrons directly to your home—all electricity mixes on the shared grid regardless of generation source. Renewable energy certificates ensure that your consumption gets matched with clean generation elsewhere on the grid, while local utility infrastructure maintains actual power delivery. The grid's interconnected nature means renewable electricity effectively replaces fossil fuel generation without creating reliability issues.
